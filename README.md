## 1. Project Title
**We Were Friends – Nostalgia-powered Reconnection Platform**

---

## 2. Name & Roll Number
Ambuj Vashistha – [2024-B-14042006]

---

## 3. Problem Statement
People often lose touch with friends, classmates, or acquaintances from the past. Memories fade, and opportunities for genuine reconnection are rare. Existing social media platforms are too noisy or impersonal, making it difficult to relive and share nostalgic moments safely and meaningfully.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea
A web and mobile platform where users can post memories about old friends or life moments, refer people who might fit those memories, and reconnect through author-validated confirmations. The platform also includes global chat, themed rooms, and social features like follow/connect to build a wholesome, nostalgia-driven community.

---

## 5. Key Features
- Memory posts with tags (school, year, mood, location) and optional anonymity  
- Referral system: users suggest who a memory might belong to, with author confirmation for success  
- Points & badges for engagement (gamification)  
- Global chat with keyword filtering, moderation, and optional nostalgia prompts  
- Rooms (public or invite-only) for focused group conversations  
- Follow & Connect system (LinkedIn-style) for lightweight following or deeper reconnections  

---

## 6. Target Users / Audience
Anyone wanting to reconnect with old friends, classmates, or past acquaintances. Schools, colleges, hostels, and alumni groups would particularly benefit. Users looking for nostalgic bonding or meaningful online social interaction.

## 7. Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React (web), React Native (mobile)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (or Django/Flask)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MySQL for structured data (users, memories, points)  
- **Realtime Communication:** WebSockets / Firebase Realtime DB (global chat, rooms)  
- **Authentication:** OAuth + email verification  
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify for frontend, AWS/Heroku for backend  

---

## 8. Expected Outcome
A functional web and mobile platform where users can post and explore memories, refer people, earn points for successful connections, chat globally or in rooms, follow or connect with other users, and safely relive nostalgic moments. The platform will foster genuine reconnections while providing light gamification for engagement.
